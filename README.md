# Loan Default Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing loan default behavior in financial institutions, identifying key factors that influence whether a loan will default. The analysis covers various aspects such as loan amount, interest rates, credit score, and customer behavior to predict defaults and help mitigate risks for lending institutions.

## Key Objectives
1. **Loan Default Analysis**: Examine loan features (e.g., loan type, interest rates) that contribute to defaults.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Develop insights into high-risk loan categories and customer segments.
3. **Predictive Insights**: Identify potential default patterns based on customer and loan attributes.
4. **Business Strategy**: Provide actionable recommendations to reduce loan defaults and improve risk management strategies.

## Insights and Findings

### 1. Data Overview
- **Dataset**: Contains loan details, customer demographics, payment history, and loan outcomes (default or paid).
- **Key Columns**:
  - `loan_id`: Unique identifier for each loan.
  - `loan_amount`: The amount of money loaned.
  - `interest_rate`: Interest rate applied to the loan.
  - `credit_score`: Customer's credit score.
  - `payment_history`: Details of payment regularity.
  - `loan_status`: Outcome of the loan (paid or defaulted).

### 2. Loan Default Analysis
- **Risk Factors**: Loans with higher interest rates and larger loan amounts tend to have higher default rates. Customers with lower credit scores are also more likely to default.
- **Payment Behavior**: Delayed payments and high debt-to-income ratios are strong indicators of potential loan defaults.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used includes loan history, customer data, and default outcomes sourced from financial institution logs.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and transforming categorical variables for modeling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations were created to understand correlations between loan features and default rates.
4. **Risk Insights**: Key insights were derived by analyzing loan amounts, interest rates, and customer credit scores to predict default likelihood.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **SQL**: For querying and handling loan-related data.
- **Power BI**: For building interactive dashboards and visualizing loan performance.
